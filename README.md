- Major issues when used for 'real world' use cases:
    - Will do full re-write and call previous version a prototype [also kept as branch]
    - Target user is still myself

Changes
- Requiring top level author to exists even though atom does not necessarily require
  top level author if all entries have authors
    - Since entries data will be hand generated, it is safer to have top level
      author
- Making URI requirement of atom as URL
